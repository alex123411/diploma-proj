Web application designated to scrap data from job posting websites 

  **Abstract:**
  
  This diploma project is devoted to the creation of a web application for
the analysis of job portals.
  As part of the implementation of the project, a comparative analysis of
available development tools was carried out and tools such as the Node.js
platform, the Express.js and React.js libraries, and the MySQL relational
database were selected, which are best suited for solving the given task.
  An architecture was also chosen for the implementation of the
functionality of the software application, with the expectation of further
possibilities of expanding the web service. The diploma project developed and
described the main algorithms and modules that are executed by the software
application to ensure the operation of the program.
  The web application itself is a website that allows the user to enter the
desired job title to receive statistical and structured data in the form of graphs,
medians, averages and lists. By offering the following information to the user
about the labor market, the web application facilitates the effective analysis of
desired vacancies.
  Also, the software was created with the possibility of integrating
additional sources, namely job portals. In the future, this will provide the user
with a more extensive analysis of the labor market and will provide an
opportunity to conclude which of the websites is better to search for
employment.
  So, this software application makes it easier to analyze vacancies located
on various services for finding employment.
